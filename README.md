This is the official implementation of the paper "MAPS: Motivation-Aware Personalized Search via LLM-Driven Consultation Alignment" based on PyTorch. Please note that the code of this project is still being organized, and the methods are continuously being improved.


## Overview

The main implementation of MAPS can be found in the file `models/cs/TEM_0206_Final.py`.

## Experimental Setting
The settings of can be found in file `utils/const.py`.


## Quick Start

### 1. Download data
Download and unzip the processed data [Amazon](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mXzVD8tjeD0wyOS879xGWA?pwd=3rbm). Place data files in the folder `data`.

### 2. Satisfy the requirements
The requirements can be found in file `requirements.txt`.

### 3. Train and evaluate our model:
Refer to the example in `GO.sh` and customize your hyperparameters and command.

### 4. Check training and evaluation process:
After training, check `./output` for logs and results. For the sake of convenience, you can utilize `results_to_excel.ipynb` to present the performances of all experiments in the form of an excel table.
